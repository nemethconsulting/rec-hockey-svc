## Using curl

### Find your team

1. Locate your team with a simple `GET` call to the `teams` resource.

```bash
curl {base_url}/teams
```
2. The response should look like:

```bash
[
  {
    "id": "1",
    "teamName": "Bellevue Bison",
    "headquarters": "Bellevue, WA",
    "mascot": "Benny the Bison",
    "winLossRatio": "1-1",
    "coach": "Jordan Rinkside",
    "numberOfPlayers": 18,
    "arenaName": "Bellevue Ice Palace",
    "arenaAddress": "123 Ice Palace Ave, Bellevue, WA 98004"
  },
  {
    "id": "2",
    "teamName": "Renton Raptors",
    "headquarters": "Renton, WA",
    "mascot": "Rocky the Raptor",
    "winLossRatio": "1-0-1",

```bash
{

  "teamName": "Kirkland Kraken",
  "season": "2024-2025",
